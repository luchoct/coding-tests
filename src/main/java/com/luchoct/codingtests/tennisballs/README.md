# Tennis Balls Counter

In front of you there is a bucket of tennis balls of size n.

All tennis balls are yellow except for one that is blue.

You are blindfolded.

You can reach into the bucket and pull out one random tennis ball at a time.

* If the ball is blue, you win.
* If the ball is yellow, put it back and add another brand new yellow tennis ball to the bucket.

How many rounds of the game do you need to play to have a 50% chance of winning?

Write the implementation of the function playGame(int n) and simulate this scenario, returning an integer representing the number of rounds needed.
